    <h1>Feedback from Playtests</h1>

    <div class="text-box">
        <p>
            This playtest was our first opportunity to gain feedback on what others thought of our game. Our 
            alpha did not have as much of the game's content as we might've wanted, it was more of a technical 
            demo of all of the individual parts coming together for the first time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Players of our game largely gave us feedback on the feel of the player movement, art style, enemy 
            attacks, and map design. They loved the art and design, however one big piece of feedback players 
            had problems with was that the players movement felt slow and clunky. In future updates, we hope to
            put together more of the games fundamentals including different enemies and a boss fight, as well 
            as fixing the smaller issues players brought up.
        </p>

        <p>
            This playtest represented the first place where we had a fully functional, if a bit simple, game. 
            Largely the players really enjoyed the art style, the improved character movement, and the pathfinding 
            was much improved from previous versions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For the upcoming final playtest, we hope to have fixed many of the bugs that players pointed out 
            including: the pathfinding issue where enemies get stuck on each other, the boss not being a very 
            interesting fight, the enemies tendency to swarm the player all at once, and others. We also hope to 
            refine mechanics and UI elements such as working with picking up ammo/shooting, as well as adding a 
            fully working knife to the game. 
        </p>

        <p>
            For the last set of changes before the final deadline, we will be focusing on fixing the bugs that 
            hinder players from progressing through the game, mainly the door causing the player to be stuck at 
            the boss room. Likewise, we will try and fix the interactions with the potatoes colliding on one 
            another, but may not be successful as the collision is a part of the A* pathfinding mechanism.
        </p>

        <p>
            For future extensions, we hope to be able to implement more enemy types, more level design and 
            exploration, different ammo types depending on the different enemy drops, and possibly more player
            mechanics like a dash and roll.

    <h1>Team Reflections</h1>

    <div class="text-box">
        <p>
            As a team, we think that we were very ambitious with what we wanted to implement for our game. Originally, 
            we had a lot of creative ideas that we planned to add, but realized that it was too much for what we 
            could handle while juggling the important basic aspects of the game, and with our own personal lives. 
            Over the course of the class, we discovered that some of the implementations we wanted were more 
            challenging than expected, so we decided to focus more on setting up one level with a focus on enemy 
            design, level design, level mechanics, and animations. We think that the animations for the enemies and 
            the players turned out really well as it was our first time working with animations in Unity. The 
            movements of the animations intertwine together well and it makes the characters look like they are 
            performing actions like moving and hitting. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If we were given another two weeks to work on the game, we think that our top three highest priority 
            items would be to set up a second level, implement different ammo types for the different enemies, and 
            increase the difficulty of the game even more.
