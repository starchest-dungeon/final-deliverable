            The following two links display our development process for the game.  Development began around the week 
            of October 17th, 2022 once our final groups were assigned.  Our team held meeetings every week - or 
            sometimes every other week - in order to stay updated on eachother's progress.  We also connected over Discord to aid and speak
            with one another about the game, it was a great resource for us to quickly show what we've been working on.
            Our github repository is also stored below, within is the source code of our Unity project.

            Throughout the quarter, we tried our best to follow an Agile workflow.  Goals were set to be met each Sunday
            and at the beginning of each week during our Monday class session we would set new goals.  This method did not
            hold up well, by the end of the quarter we simply chose some game task to work on and moved on to the next once
            complete.

        <p>
            Throughout the development of our game, most of the art and all of the animations were created by members
            of our team.  The only outside resource we made use of was an asset pack listed in our source document below.
            Since we were each learning Unity and didn't have much experience with the platform, we made use of many tutorials
            when working with the game system or with the scripting C++ code.  (*further references and resources are credited
            within our Unity C++ files themselves)
